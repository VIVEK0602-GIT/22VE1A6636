# Simple HTTP URL Shortener

This is a basic URL shortener microservice built with Node.js and Express. It lets you create short links for any valid URL, keeps track of how many times each link is used, and automatically expires links after 30 minutes. All important actions are logged to a remote logging API.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2. Open a terminal in the `backend` folder.
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```
   node index.js
   ```
5. The server will run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## How to Use

### 1. Create a Short URL

Send a POST request:
```
POST http://localhost:3000/shorturls
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "url": "https://example.com"
}
```
You’ll get a response like:
```json
{
  "shortcode": "abc123",
  "expires": 1752823940567
}
```

### 2. Use the Short URL

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000/abc123
```
You’ll be redirected to the original URL.

### 3. Get Usage Stats

Send a GET request:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/shorturls/abc123
```
You’ll get:
```json
{
  "shortcode": "abc123",
  "visits": 1,
  "expires": 1752823940567
}
```

## Notes

- All data is stored in memory, so it resets if you restart the server.
- Links expire after 30 minutes.
- All actions are logged to a remote API as required.
